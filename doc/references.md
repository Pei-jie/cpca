* [Zhang et al., Feature Transformation with Class Conditional Decorrelation, 2013 (pdf)](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/xyz/Publication/XYZ2013-class_conditional_decorrelation-ICDM.pdf):
  Fisher DA = Whitenning + PCA. Implementation of Whitenning was proposed to be Class Conditional Correlation (CCD). 
 CCD takes a list of class-related covariance matrices and diagonalizes them simultaneously.
