## PCA

* [MetaPCA](https://github.com/donkang34/MetaPCA) Simultaneous dimension reduction using PCA when multiple studies are combined. ; available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MetaPCA/index.html)
  * eigenvalue maximization approach and angle minimization approach
  * extension for Robust PCA and Sparse PCA in the meta-analysis realm

## Multivariate Methods

* [Zhang et al., Feature Transformation with Class Conditional Decorrelation, 2013 (pdf)](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/xyz/Publication/XYZ2013-class_conditional_decorrelation-ICDM.pdf):
  Fisher DA = Whitenning + PCA. Implementation of Whitenning was proposed to be Class Conditional Correlation (CCD). 
 CCD takes a list of class-related covariance matrices and diagonalizes them simultaneously.

## Tests

* [Rublik, A TEST OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF PARTIAL COMMON PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS, 2009 (pdf)](http://www.um.sav.sk/en/images/stories/dep03/doc/FRHypothesisPCPC.pdf):
  See Introduction for literature review.
* [Boente et al., Robust tests for the common principal components model, 2009 (pdf)](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/222548516_Robust_tests_for_the_common_principal_components_model/file/9fcfd50df235394ee4.pdf):
  See Section 7 Final Comments for a good summary.
* Diego et al., (2014) GAW19 contribution.
